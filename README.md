Open source hardware for a continuous wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO) in the mid-infrared regime.


## History

We needed a narrowband, tunable, continuous wave light source for coherent radiation at 606 nm. The result is this optical parametric oscillator with intra-cavity sum frequency generation, similar to a special version of the Aculight Argos 2400 laser system previously sold by Lockheed Martin. This is described in *Tunable, continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator with more than 1W output power in the orange visible spectrum* by S. Mieth et al. [DOI10.1364/OE.22.011182](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-22-9-11182).

The design works for mid-infrared laser light as well, if the sum frequency part is left out. In fact, we use a second model with different mirror coatings and crystal for light at 2550 nm.
